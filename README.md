# Safari Sketch Library
Sketch library for Safari UI by [Brent Caswell](https://brentcas.com/).

In the library, I include examples using Sketch’s desktop artboard presets: 1024px and 1440px. Using artboard presets is [helpful when creating prototypes](https://www.sketch.com/docs/prototyping/fixed-elements) in Sketch, so I tend to stick with those. The symbols are resizable, so you can use them with any screen size you’d like. Be sure to update the “macOS/Safari Toolbar” symbol with your URL.

Here’s how to setup the symbols:

- 🔄 macOS/Menu Bar
- 📂 Safari
	- 🔄 macOS/Safari Toolbar
	- 📂 macOS/Window Frame - Detach to Mask
		- Put your design here
		- ⬆️ Mask
- 🔄 macOS/Wallpaper/1024px

I’d like to continue expanding this library to support iOS and watchOS Safari elements, in addition to light and dark appearances as website begin to use the [dark mode media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).
